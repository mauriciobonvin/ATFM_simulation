# Operating the Framework  
This is a comprehensive guide on how to operate the developed ATFM simulation framework effectively. It is designed to help users understand the practical steps involved in deploying and utilizing the framework, from initial setup to executing simulation steps. The following subsections cover the installation process, the configuration of the framework, and a demonstration with an example.  

## Installation and Setup  
This section outlines the essential steps required to install and prepare the ATFM simulation framework for operation. The installation process focuses on ensuring that the correct version of Python is installed and that all necessary dependencies are properly set up. By following these guidelines, users can quickly get the framework ready for use. The section references the official Python documentation and other relevant resources for detailed instructions on Python installation and managing dependencies.  

The simulation framework was developed using **Python version 3.10.9**, which is the recommended version to run the simulations.  

The following Python packages are also required for the framework to work properly:  

- **Random**: A module for generating random numbers and making random selections in Python. [(Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)  
- **Copy**: A module providing support for shallow and deep copying operations in Python. [(Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)  
- **Logging**: A module that implements an event-logging system for Python applications. [(Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)  
- **Json**: A module that encodes and decodes JSON files. [(Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)  
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python. The version used in the simulation framework is **1.24.2**. [(Documentation)](https://numpy.org/doc/)  
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation in Python. The version used in the simulation framework is **2.2.1**. [(Documentation)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
- **Docplex.mp.model**: A module from the `docplex` library, an optimization modeling library for Python provided by IBM Decision Optimization. The recommended version is **2.25.236**. [(Documentation)](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/mp/docplex.mp.model.html)  
  - The free version of this package is limited, and it is recommended to obtain an academic license to remove size limitations when running optimization simulations. [(Academic License Details)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ai-datascience/blogs/xavier-nodet1/2020/07/09/cplex-free-for-students)  
- **Mesa**: An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework developed in Python. The version used for developing the framework is **2.1**. It can be installed using:  
  ```sh
  pip install "git+https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa.git@v2.1.0"
  ```
  [(Documentation)](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Configuration  
This section provides an overview of the configuration steps necessary to customize the air traffic flow management simulation framework according to specific operational needs. Proper configuration ensures that the framework operates efficiently and aligns with the intended simulation scenarios. The configuration process involves selecting and setting simulation parameters and agent behaviors.  

To configure the ATFM simulation framework, we import the modules for the strategies and define the parameters. Then, we create the inputs required for the `ATFMSimulation` model. The following example illustrates how to initiate the configuration of the ATFM simulation framework.  

A Python file named **`setup.py`** is created. In this file, we define the framework's strategies and parameters that control how the simulation operates.  

### Importing Modules for Setup  
```python
# Import modules for setup
# Time assignment strategy
import TimeAssignmentStrategy
# Network manager agent strategies
import WindowStrategy
import RegulationStrategy
# Airline agent strategies
import PriorityAssignmentStrategy
import DesiredTimeStrategy
import AssignMarginsStrategy
# Platform agent strategies
import OptimizationStrategy
import EquityMonitorStrategy
import InterveneEquityStrategy
```

### Setting Simulation Parameters  
```python
# Set parameters
steps = 100  # Number of simulation iterations
n_times_ = 100  # Number of available time slots
starting_seed_ = 0
# Weight map parameters
base_value_weight_map_ = 100
percentage_reduction_weight_map_ = 0.1
```

### Initializing Strategies for Simulation  
```python
# Strategies used
# Regular schedule time assignment strategy
time_assignment_strategy = TimeAssignmentStrategy.RandomTimeAssignmentStrategy(time_assignment_seed=0)
# Network manager agent strategies
window_strategy_ = WindowStrategy.RandomWindowStrategy()
regulation_strategy_ = RegulationStrategy.ReducedCapacityStrategy(capacity=2)
# Airline's flight prioritization strategies
priority_assignment_strategy = PriorityAssignmentStrategy.PriorityRandomAssignmentStrategy()
desired_time_strategy = DesiredTimeStrategy.DesiredTimeRandomAssignmentStrategy()
assign_margins_strategy = AssignMarginsStrategy.MarginsRandomAssignmentStrategy()
# Platform agent strategies
optimization_strategy_ = OptimizationStrategy.LinearAssignmentStrategy()
equity_monitor_strategy_ = EquityMonitorStrategy.CreditsClearingStrategy(initial_credits=100)
intervene_equity_strategy_ = InterveneEquityStrategy.CreditBasedInterventionStrategy(equity_threshold=0)
```

## Running the Simulation  
A **`main.py`** file is created as the entry point for running the air traffic flow management simulation. It imports necessary modules, initializes the simulation with the configured parameters, sets up logging, and executes the simulation for a specified number of steps.  

### Initializing and Running the Model  
```python
import ATFMSimulation
import Setup
import logging
import LoggingConfiguration

# Initialize the simulation model with parameters from Setup
model = ATFMSimulation.ATFMSimulationModel(
    n_times=Setup.n_times_,
    seed=Setup.starting_seed_,
    time_assignment_strategy=Setup.time_assignment_strategy,
    network_manager_agent=Setup.network_manager_agent_,
    list_airline_agents=Setup.list_airline_agents_,
    platform_agent=Setup.platform_agent_
)

LoggingConfiguration.configure_logging()

for i in range(Setup.steps):
    model.step()
```

## Output Data  
The output data of the simulation framework is stored in a machine-readable format as a JSON file named **`Output_data.json`**. The log file **`Simulation_log.log`** is also generated, containing intermediate results for traceability.
